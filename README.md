# Portsey
Portsey is my first complete Python3 script and is a little bit like the "netstat -tuln" command, showing the open ports on a machine but with the added benefit of tying this data to local services, binaries and processes just as the "lsof" or "ss" commands would. I recommend creating an alias to run this Python script for quicker access.
